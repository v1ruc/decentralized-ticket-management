# Decentralized event ticket management

Digital identity and taking ownership of your data we believe are key things towards mass adoption of de-centralization. While participating at the conference digital identity was raised multiple times. What if a digital identity could not only grant you access to digital world but unify access to physical world as well. This is how we came up with a ticket management dApp idea for hackathons like [EthBerlinZwei](https://twitter.com/ETHBerlin).

## Actors of the dApp

- Event Participant
- Event Organizer
- Event Vulunteers, Security-check/Canteen worker etc.

## Tools to be used for final product

- Monetha platform SDK. Maintain digital identity and data (aka information) ownership
- OpenZeppelin GSN "meta transactions" to make a seamless onboarding for users who sign-up for event.
- React for App interface
